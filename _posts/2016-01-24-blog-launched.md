Finally got around to setting this up. After much thought, I decided to call this "__The Experimental Blog__". The reasoning is quite simple really. Looking back at my career in Software Engineering and Architecture, I realized that it has been one long journey in experimentation with various technologies, approaches, stacks, languages etc. So to write about the things I work on would effectively be an experiment in itself since I love tinkering with various things. 

The primary reason for writing this blog is to get my thoughts out there for myself to come back to when I need to. That being said, if someone finds this useful or a way to make this useful to others, a suggestion or a comment would be appreciated.
